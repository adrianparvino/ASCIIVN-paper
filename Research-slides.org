* Introduction
** What is this study about?
A verification of the methodology of cite:dehnadi2006camel, 
specifically on their use of the equality symbol.

** Why was this conceived?
The conclusion of cite:dehnadi2006camel points to the possibility that not everyone can program,
however, their methodology appears to be flawed.

* Importance of the Study
The success of this study will contribute to Computer Science Education.

- H_0 :: Their research remains to not disproven and thus may still
         prove to be true, thus an additional methodology may actually
         exist.
- H_a :: Their research is disproven and thus may be proven to be
         false, thus perhaps anyone can actually learn programming.

* Research Design and Methodology
** Experimental
A comparison between equality symbol (=; control) and arrow symbol (<-; treatment).
** Examination type
* Results and Discussion

Fisher's exact test of independence (\alpha = 0.05)
- All data :: p = 0.9339
- No blanks :: p = 1
- One-tailed :: p = 0.7532 

* Conclusion
The null hypothesis therefore isn't rejected, and
this paper does not prove that their methodology is flawed.
