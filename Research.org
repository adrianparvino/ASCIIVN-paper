* Introduction
** Background of the Study
#+BEGIN_quote
The camel has a single hump; The dromedary, two; Or else the other way
around, I'm never sure. Are you?

-- Ogden Nash
#+END_quote

Mistakes happen all the time. 
People were mistaken and believed that the camels' humps functioned as storage of water. 
As members of the society, it is our duty to debunk misconceptions 
that have been spread as gossip and hearsay.
Just as it was a common misconception that the function of the camels' humps,
cite:dehnadi2006camel may have also been mistaken in their research
with respect to the existence of double hump with respect to Computer Science[fn::
The researchers would just like to emphasize that Computer Science and Computer Programming are /distinct/; 
however, with exception to special cases, Computer Programming can be considered a prerequisite to Computer Science] 
Education. 
citep:bornat2014camels,bornat2008mental claim that 
it is widely believed between computer science professors that 
there are just some people who can't program.
The researchers disagree with that sentiment, as anecdotally, 
many of the Electronic and Communications Engineering students that they had encountered 
at least had the ability to understand and modify code; 
this may be linked to Electronics and Communications Engineering having the tendency to just ``accept'' the rules, 
however, this is purely speculation. 
The ability to accept rules without clear reasoning is
one of the requirements in programming according to cite:dehnadi2006camel.
It would be everyone's best interest if it does not exist as 
this implies that with proper education and motivation, 
everyone can indeed program. 
However, if it were true, this would imply that both glspl:institution and students 
can both benefit as preliminary screening could be performed 
in order to avoid wasting time and resources on both parties.

# TODO: more stuff
# Furthermore, if the statements were actually true, 

# As
# further informal proof, quite often, experienced programmers often
# complain about

# TODO: Something

** Statement of the Problem
Can the students' performance be accurately predicted by the [[glspl:consistencytest][consistency tests]] 
deviced by the researchers and by cite:dehnadi2006camel?

Specifically, the following questions are investigated:
  1. Do the different glspl:consistencytest show similar results?
     - H_a :: The glspl:consistencytest show dependence.
     - H_0 :: The glspl:consistencytest do not show dependence.

** Literature Review
The focus of the review lies on citetitle:dehnadi2006camel as this
paper is a derivative work.
*** citetitle:dehnadi2006camel
The researchers found the use of the gls:equalitysymbol in the test quite questionable; 
in fact, cite:dehnadi2006camel had also acknowledged this and specifically stated 
``[W]e normally excoriate this appalling design decision'' 
and further added that it was, to borrow their words, ``crass idiocy'';
the first statement is once again repeated in citep:bornat2008mental. 
The researchers speculate that they continued to use that for the following reasons, 
(a) to test if they can gls:decouple their previous learning, and
(b) in order to actually test if they would be able to understand actual programming. 
To add to the confusion, they also continued to use the gls:equalitysymbol in the test choices,
which means gls:mathematicalequality rather than gls:assignment.
Another thing to note is that some programming languages 
(e.g. Haskell[fn::However, the bound variable still remains to be declared at the left-hand-side.]), 
actually do have gls:mathematicalequality as the definition of the gls:equalitysymbol. 
As the test isn't available at the time of writing; 
the online test developed in cite:onlinetest will serve as the basis of the the paper test which will is attached as [[Appendix A][Appendix A]].

# Aside from simple graphical analysis, there has been no mention of a
# bimodality test.

*** citetitle:bornat2008mental
cite:bornat2008mental stated in his paper that 
a significant number of novice computer programmers have never learned to program during their University course;
this sentiment is supported by cite:mccracken2001multi. 
He then further state that he chose to teach programming by way of formal reasoning [[cite:bornat2008mental][Bornat, 1986 cited in::]]
If expert programmers could justify their programs, 
perhaps novices could be taught to program by first learning to formalise their reasoning. 
Examples of which is by reading books on programming languages, analytical thinking and reasoning. 
Reading plenty of resources on programming language and algorithms. 
cite:murnane1993psychology related programming to psychological theories, 
specifically Chomsky’s notion of natural language acquisition and Piaget’s theories of education.

*** citetitle:bornat2014camels
cite:bornat2014camels states in his paper that during the creation of
citep:dehnadi2006camel, he was experiencing depression. This resulted
in a confirmation bias that there are students that really could not
learn. However, implications can be found all around the paper that
they believe that their prior claims were not completely invalid; 
a very clear example would be in his own words, 
``I believe that the problem is real but that we don’t understand its causes'' (p. 1)
Furthemore, he cites other researches[[cite:bornat2014camels][Bornat, Dehnadi, & Simon, 2008;
Dehnadi, 2009; Caspersen, Larsen, & Bennedsen, 2007, all cited in::]]
that use the testing methods they had developed. 
This leads the researchers to be compelled to continue where they left off.

*** Synthesis
The similarity of the studies conducted by cite:dehnadi2006camel and
cite:bornat2008mental was that both tested the teaching approaches of
the researchers to novices or amateur programmers, and whether if
their methods were adequate enough to teach novice programmers to
catch up to expert programmers in terms of their ability to gls:decouple
their learning, and to test if they can actually understand actual
programming as stated in cite:dehnadi2006camel. And to teach
programming by way of formal reasoning, and to test that, perhaps
maybe novices could be taught to program by first learning to
formalize their reasoning. And lastly, in cite:bornat2014camels it was
stated that the first research which was the cite:dehnadi2006camel was
basically made because of the depression the researcher went
through. However, the researchers believe that Bornat isn’t trying to
complete invalidate all their prior claims. Clear examples would be
citing different researches that used the said testing methods,
getting them to the decision to continue what the researchers started.

*** Other studies
cite:bricklin2002 made an informal synthesis and concluded with the following: 
(a) immediately observable results are easier to grok; 
(b) less amount of instructions are easier to understand; 
(c) instructions that have a clear effect on the results tend to be more engaging.
Point c might have an implication on this study: 
the gls:equalitysymbol in cite:dehnadi2006camel was used in 2 contexts;
this might cause confusion within the respondents producing worse results.

cite:chalk2003improving created a major change in the curriculum and learning environment.
One of those changes were adding interactive visualization on abstract topics;
this contrasts with claims of cite:dehnadi2006camel that different paradigms had been attempted yet 
none resulted in any significant improvement.

** Importance of the Study
Just like our predecessors, cite:dehnadi2006camel, 
this research paper aims to quantitatively evaluate the students' understanding of programming. 
An alternative importance was demonstrated where 
one assesses not the students but rather the effectiveness of the curriculum of a given course
such as in the case of cite:ford2010assessing.
The success of this study is beneficial whether or not 
the consistency test developed by citeauthor:dehnadi2006camel does have predictive capabilities.

If consistency test results do not correlate with programming capabilities,
this hints but not conclusively implies that anyone can be a programmer; specifically, 
this might be beneficial to the industry as programmers are often in demand;
online, there is a general consensus that skilled programmers are deficit.

However, if there a correlation does exist, 
both the gls:institution and the students benefit in terms of time and resources.
Glspl:institution will be able to focus the workforce on those who have a higher guarantee of learning.

# As our world tends to get deeper into technology, knowledge of
# computers start to become indispensible. Even way back in 1990s,
# Computer Programming is present in Electronic and Communications
# Engineering.

** Scope and Delimitation
The population of the study is constrained only to the Grade 12 Senior High School students of University of San Carlos; 
this is not due to time and resource constraint, but instead, 
the researchers are only interested in the performances of the Grade 12 students since
# TODO: fix
after graduation from Senior High, they'll have to choose their courses; and
the researchers are specifically targetting University of San Carlos since 
not only is Information Technology and Computer Science taught here,
but also Electronic and Communications Engineering 
which has close ties with Computer Programming
such as in the case of Icarus Verilog citep:iverilog, 
which is a [[gls:hdl][hardware description language]].

As had been observed by citep:dehnadi2006camel, 
some of the participants are expected to
decline either due to lack of free time or even simple disinterest.
The former can become a problem due to a possible bias in the results,
specifically that our population will be skewed to those who are
interested in Computer Science.

Furthermore, although this paper explores the effects of different representations of programming, 
it is not within the scope of the study to identify which programming concepts are difficult to understand. 
As such, the findings of this research should not be used to research to 
dissect teaching curricula into their strengths and weakness; rather, 
it should only be used to quantify its effectiveness.

The instrument might also be susceptible to the same problems as cite:dehnadi2006camel,
although in this research, an ``arrow'' was used, 
it was in ASCII form and not in Unicode form,
rather than ~<-~, ← should have been used.

Finally, as a derivative of the work of the study by cite:dehnadi2006camel, 
the focus lies on two things: 
first, the research aims to assess students with different testing methods and 
next, compared the regression of the different testing methods to one another.
# the resulting [[gls:modality][modality]] of the tests administered
# and most importantly, to see if the different testing methods result
# in an offset.


# ** Structure of the study
# The paper is split into two parts. The first part contains a
# meta-analysis that is centered on citep:dehnadi2006camel, and two
# papers that are loose follow-ups: cite:bornat2008mental and
# citep:bornat2014camels. The second part of the study will contain
# analyses on different methodologies that are derived from the aptitude
# tests conducted by cite:dehnadi2006camel. This should be able to
# achieve two things: perform a meta-analysis on citep:dehnadi2006camel
# to verify the modality of the Computer Science curve, and confirm if
# the results are replicable in University of San Carlos: Talamban
# Campus.

# In the second chapter, we will review the results in
# cite:dehnadi2006camel. In particular, we will perform a synthesis with
# two follow-up papers, citep:bornat2008mental and
# citep:bornat2014camels. In the third chapter, we will describe the
# methodology and how it relates to the synthesis of our literature
# review. In the fourth chapter, the results will be announced. In the
# final chapter, we will form a conclusion. The appendices contain the
# data collected from the surveys along with the paper and electronic
# survey.

* Methodology
** Research Design
The design is experimental and correlational in nature.  
The researchers will conduct multiple experiments which include different paradigms in programming. 
# Afterwards, the participants of the paper survey will once again be sampled from in order to conduct the electronic survey. 
# The paper survey only assesses the underlying model of programming while 
# the electronic survey is done in order to actually assess one's capabilities in proramming.

** Participants and Sampling Technique
Fifty samples each are taken for the different examinations. 
There are 9 blocks in University of San Carlos -- Talamban Campus.
Both random and non-random sampling techniques are performed. 
Stratified sampling with the strata as the Grade 12 blocks in University of San Carlos -- Talamban Campus is performed
which is followed by a quota sampling with 5 to 6 students per block.
# The respondents of the consistency test are then stratified according to the results
# and a second pass of stratified sampling is performed.

# The researchers will analyze the results of those
# that are (a) in the first years in Computer Science, in the successive
# years, (b) in Computer Science, or (c) in a different course and/or no
# interest in Computer Science. There will be two passes of stratified
# sampling. The first pass is done on the whole population of students
# from University of San Carlos, while the second pass is done only on
# the participants of the participants of the paper survey. The
# population of the electronic task is the participants of the first
# task.

** Research Instrument
A paper survey is conducted; 
the contents of the paper survey is attached as Appendices [[Appendix A][A]] and [[Appendix B][B]].

** Data Gathering Procedure
The researchers will distribute the paper survey to each classroom that is included in the population. 

** Data Analysis
# TODO: add contingency table to gls
The Fisher's exact test of independence is performed to verify that 
the equality symbol (=) model and the arrow symbol (<-) show
different models due to the treatment of the removal of
type annotations and the replacement of the equality symbol with the arrow symbol.

|---------------------+------------+--------------+-------+-------|
Although 101 consistency tests were sent out, only 37 were returned, and furthermore,
6 of the papers were returned as blank;
the same phenomenon was also observed in cite:dehnadi2006camel, where
people decline to participate due to not perceiving the value of partaking in the exam.

Treating the data with Fisher's exact test of independence shows that 
the independence between equality symbol (=) and the arrow symbol (<-) have a p-value of 0.6709,
thus, failing to reject the null hypothesis which implies that
the study cannot claim that the the arrow symbol shows a different distribution than the equality symbol.

Taking only those who were interested in answering the exams;
the blank group is is removed and once again 
treating the data with Fisher's exact test of independence gives us a higher p-value of 1.

Furthermore, the data also shows a concentration on the inconsistent group. 
This is most likely related to the lack of instructions;
however, that's just following as per the methodology of cite:dehnadi2006camel.


* Conclusion and Recommendations

** Conclusion
The results of this research is two-fold:
first, the claims by cite:dehnadi2006camel that 
alternative paradigms are not effective for education has not been disproven,
and second, neither was their methodology been proven to be flawed.
# The claims by cite:dehnadi2006camel that different paradigms are ineffictive for education has not been disproven by this research because
# despite using a more comprehensible symbol, the distribution remains the same.

** Recommendations
The sample size in this study was greatly reduced due to external factors. 
A more rigorous data collection is thus adviced, amongst other things.

Furthermore, following the footsteps of cite:dehnadi2006camel, 
a second test should have been administered in order to 
verify their claims of bimodality.

However, against the instructions of cite:dehnadi2006camel,
the researchers suggest giving in-depth instructions on the operational semantics of the symbols as
the researchers conjecture that this would result in a more even statistics between consistent and inconsistent groups.
